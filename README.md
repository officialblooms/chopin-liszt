## About

Chopin Liszt is a discord bot made as a passion project over the summer of 2024 as a way to practice my Python programming skills, but also expand my knowledge of the musical world. It's a much WIP project at the moment as there is no way to add the bot to other servers but I am hoping to do that before 2025!

# Features

- Posts a daily message in a specified text channel about a random classical composer's life and featured works, as well as a random Beatles song and its history (all Gemini generated)
- ```$playlist <link>:``` posts a link of a random song from a Spotify playlist the user specifies with ```<link>```
- ```$randomcar:``` Posts a picture of a random car along with information about the car provided by Google Gemini
- ```$randomnumber:``` starts a game where the user must guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 37 from the bot
- ```$randomnumberhard:``` starts a game where the user must guess the 5 random numbers by the bot, and the bot adds a new random number every 5 guesses (it is very hard)
- Posts a random youtube link from the OfficialBlooms channel (my channel lol) whenever someone posts a message with "officialblooms" or "blooms" in the content
